# Create Media

The “LibreELEC USB-SD Creator” app helps you choose and download the latest image for your HTPC device and create bootable USB or SD Card media. The tool is available for Windows 10 and newer, macOS 10.9 and newer, and Ubuntu Linux 32/64 bit (and should also work on other Debian derivatives).

* [LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Win32.exe](https://releases.libreelec.tv/LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Win32.exe)
* ~~LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.macOS.dmg~~ ([currently not available](https://libreelec.tv/2022/04/05/usb-sd-creator-1-4/))
* ~~LibreELEC.USB-SD.Creator.Linux-64bit.bin~~ ([currently not available](https://libreelec.tv/2022/04/05/usb-sd-creator-1-4/))

## Step 1

Choose the LibreELEC image and the app will show the latest stable release, e.g.

* Generic x86\_64 - LibreELEC-Generic.x86\_64-11.0.1.img.gz
* RaspberryPi 2/3 - LibreELEC-RPi2.arm-11.0.1.img.gz
* RaspberryPi 4 - LibreELEC-RPi4.arm-11.0.1.img.gz

If you check 'Show all' the list also shows older stable releases and current Alpha (x.90.xxx) or Beta (x.95.0) releases.

## Step 2

After selecting the LibreELEC image and version click the `Download` button. This will prompt you to select a folder to download to. You can also select a previously downloaded image file on your machine for installation. Hit the `Select file` button and browse your computer for the .img.gz file, or drag/drop the file on the app GUI.

## Step 3

Select the USB stick or SD card to write the image onto. Click the refresh button if the removable device is not listed. Note: **ALL DATA ON THE TARGET DEVICE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN** so please ensure there is no important data on it!

## Step 4

After selecting an image and target device the `Write` button is available. Click it to write the image. Once the progress bar reaches 100% and shows `Writing done!` you can exit the app, eject the USB or SD media, and boot your device to install LibreELEC.
