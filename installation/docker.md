# Containers

The awesome folks at [LinuxServer.io](https://linuxserver.io) maintain a range of popular Docker containers installable as Kodi add-ons. After installing the Docker add-on from the LibreELEC repo, you can install the LinuxServer add-on repo \(from the LibreELEC repo\) and then install specific container add-ons. The add-ons are designed to auto-pull the latest Docker image on Kodi startup to keep your Dockers fresh.

It is also possible to install LinuxServer Docker containers from the SSH console, which is also how to access the full [fleet of LinuxServer containers](https://fleet.linuxserver.io).
