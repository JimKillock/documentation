# Add-Ons

LibreELEC builds and hosts a number of Kodi binary add-ons to extend functionality, e.g.

* Audio Encoders
* Audio Decooders
* Image Decoders
* Inputstream parsers
* PVR clients
* Screensavers
* Virtual Filesystems
* Visualisations

We also provide a range of program/service add-ons, including:

* .net Core Runtime
* Adafruit Libraries
* BTRFS Tools
* DVB Tools
* FFmpeg Tools
* Game Tools
* JRE for BD-J menus
* Multimedia Tools
* Network Tools
* Raspberry Pi Tools
* System Tools
* VDR Configuration

"Tools" add-ons bundle multiple binaries into a single add-on with a themed purpose to reduce repo maintenance. Look in the Kodi GUI and the info panel will tell you the list of binaries in each bundle.
