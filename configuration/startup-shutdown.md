# Startup & Shutdown

## autostart.sh

The `autostart.sh` script runs at the start of userspace boot. It can be used to run commands before Kodi starts. It does not exist by default, but you can create it using nano.

```text
nano /storage/.config/autostart.sh
```

You can place any commands in the script, but note they will block the boot process until they complete, so most uses of `autostart.sh` require you to "background" and delay the commands, e.g. the following script sleeps for 20 seconds and then runs a `kodi-send` command to update the video library.

```text
(
 sleep 20
 kodi-send --host=127.0.0.1 -a "UpdateLibrary(video)"
)&
```

The network stack will be up when the script runs.

## autostop.sh

The `autostop.sh` script runs during the shutdown process, but before the network is shutdown. It does not exist by default, but you can create it using nano.

```text
nano /storage/.config/autostop.sh
```

Like the `autostart.sh` script you can place any commands in the script, and they will block the shutdown process for up to 5 minutes and then will be terminated automatically.

`autostop.sh` is available as of LibreELEC 10.0.2 or LibreELEC 11 nightlies 2022-02-04.

## shutdown.sh

The `shutdown.sh` script run during the shutdown process. It does not exist by default, but you can create it using nano.

```text
nano /storage/.config/shutdown.sh
```

Unlike the `autostart.sh` script the network stack will not be up when the script runs and the `shutdown.sh` script should follow the following template to ensure commands are executed during the correct event, i.e. you can run different commands for a `reboot` event to `halt` event, or put commands outside the `case ... esac` as a catch-all.

```text
case "$1" in
  halt)
    # your commands here
    ;;
  poweroff)
    # your commands here
    ;;
  reboot)
    # your commands here
    ;;
esac
# your commands here
```
