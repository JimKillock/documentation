# Mount Network Share

Kodi can natively mount SMB, NFS, SFTP, WebDAV (and more) remote filesystems (shares) to read media for playback, but many applications that write content, e.g. TVHeadend storing TV recordings, must write to "local" storage. Remote SMB and NFS shares can be "mounted" to the local filesystem using kernel mounts configured through systemd .mount files.

The following NAS configuration is used in the examples below:

* NAS IP: `192.168.1.222`
* Username: `nasuser1`
* Password: `123nas`
* Share name: `recordings`
* Full address to share: `\\192.168.1.222\recordings`

## SMB Shares

#### 1. Create the folder where the share should be mounted

Connect to your LibreELEC HTPC with SSH.

`mkdir /storage/recordings`

#### 2. Create the systemd .mount file

**IMPORTANT:** The filename uses hyphens to separate elements of the filesystem path to the share mount-point, e.g. `/storage/recordings` will be `storage-recordings.mount` and sub folders, e.g. `/storage/recordings/tv` would be `storage-recordings-tv.mount`

Create the .mount file:

`nano /storage/.config/system.d/storage-recordings.mount`

Below is an example of the mount definition file for a Samba share:

```
[Unit]
Description=cifs mount script
Requires=network-online.service
After=network-online.service
Before=kodi.service

[Mount]
What=//192.168.1.222/recordings
Where=/storage/recordings
Options=username=nasuser1,password=123nas,rw,vers=2.1
Type=cifs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### 3. Things to edit

Address of your share. Remember to always use / slashes:

`What=//192.168.1.222/recordings`

Path where the Share should be mounted:

`Where=/storage/recordings`

Options:

`Options=username=nasuser1,password=123nas,rw,vers=2.1`

`username=` Username of your network share\
`password` Password of your network share\
`rw` Read/write access\
`vers=2.1` Version of the Samba protocol, `2.1` is supported since Windows 7 several [other versions](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba3/SMB2#Introduction) are supported too

#### 4. Enable the mount

Finally we need to enable the mountpoint.

`systemctl enable storage-recordings.mount`

#### 5. Reboot

Reboot your system to check if the mount works.

#### 6. Helpful command for troubleshooting

Get status and error messages from the mount point.

`systemctl status storage-recordings.mount`

Remove mount point and disabling it.

`systemctl disable storage-recordings.mount`

## NFS Shares

#### 1. Create the folder where the share should be mounted

Connect to your LibreELEC HTPC [with SSH](https://app.gitbook.com/accessing\_libreelec).

`mkdir /storage/recordings`

#### 2. Create the systemd definition file

**Important:** you need to use the filename for the definition file according to the folder where you want to mount your share .\
In our case `storage-recordings.mount` represent path -> `/storage/recordings`.\
If you like an subfolder `storage-recordings-tv.mount` represent path -> `/storage/recordings/tv`.

`nano /storage/.config/system.d/storage-recordings.mount`

Content of the definition file for a NFS share.

```
[Unit]
Description=test nfs mount script
Requires=network-online.service
After=network-online.service
Before=kodi.service

[Mount]
What=192.168.1.222:/usr/data2/video
Where=/storage/recordings
Options=
Type=nfs

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

#### 3. Things to edit

Address of your share;

`What=192.168.1.222:/usr/data2/video`

Path where the share should be mounted:

`Where=/storage/recordings`

Options: At this section you are able to define specific NFS options, such as the NFS version. In the example below we set Type for an NFSv3 share.

`Type=nfs`

To use an NFSv4 share:

`Type=nfs4`&#x20;

#### 4. Start it for a test:

`systemctl start storage-recordings.mount`

Note: That's only a test and the mount won't be available after a reboot. To make it available after boot you have to "enable" the service first.

#### 5. Enable the mount

If the previous test worked, then please enable the service via:

`systemctl enable storage-recordings.mount`

#### 6. Reboot

Reboot your system to see if the mount is available after boot.

#### 7. Helpful command for troubleshooting

Get status and error messages from the mount point.

`systemctl status storage-recordings.mount`

Remove mount point and disabling it.

`systemctl disable storage-recordings.mount`

## **Apple TimeCapsule**

TimeCapsule devices share files using an Apple dialect of SMB that is not compatible with the Samba `smbclient` Kodi uses to connect to SMB shares. To access media on a TimeCapsule you can follow the steps described above for connecting to Samba shares with a systemd storage mount, but with one difference: the `Options` configuration must force SMB v1.0 and legacy NTLM authentication or the mount will fail. See below:

```
Options=username=MyUser,password=MyPass,sec=ntlm,vers=1.0
```

SMB v1.0 is widely considered to be insecure, but TimeCapsules no longer receive software updates and there is no alternative; SMB v2/v3 are not supported.
